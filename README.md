# Anime-Multiverse

Newest Update :

**Adjustment**

- "Changes unit type Miko from Civillian to Military"

- "Remove tile improvements for anime building but receive additional bonus for each type of buildings (i'm really apologize if there maybe have some force close problem when loaded files from previous mods version)"

**Nerf Characters**

- "Chisato unit (Promotions) : Remove additional attack bonus when adjacent to a Takina unit"

**Buff Characters**

- "Chisato unit (Promotions) : +50% Strength vs Ranged units when defending when adjacent to a Takina unit"

- "Takina unit (Promotions) : +100% Strength vs Ranged units when attacking when adjacent to a Chisato unit"

NOTE : This mod is still WIP, there will be new characters and buildings and there may be slight changes to the character's abilities to make the game more balanced.
